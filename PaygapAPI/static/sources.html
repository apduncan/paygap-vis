                        Data was published as it was gathered, so small amounts were available before the official early April deadline.

                        Some companies reported one or more Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, indicating which fields they operate in.
                        The ONS was used to provide a heirarchical structure for these SIC codes, which are grouped at different levels.
                        Some organisations, mostly public sector, did not report any SIC codes and they could not be scraped from Companies House.
                        These have all been grouped into 'Unreported'.

                    <p>
                        The average weekly pay for each SIC grouping was also added into the database.
                        The ONS gives these estimates levels of confidence, however this uncertainty information is not represented in these visualisations.
